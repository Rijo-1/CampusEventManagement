🎓 Campus Drive Assignment – Webknot Technologies
Hey Coders!! 👋
Welcome to your challenge! 🚀
This is not just another coding task — think of it as your chance to showcase how you take
a real-world problem, break it down, and build something meaningful out of it. We want to
see your creativity, problem-solving skills, and how you bring ideas to life.
AI Assisted coding (Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable etc) is what is going to enable you to
achieve this deliverable on time.
The Scenario
Imagine you’re part of a team building a Campus Event Management Platform.
● Admin Portal (Web): Used by college staff to create events (hackathons,
workshops, tech talks, fests, etc.).
● Student App (Mobile): Used by students to browse events, register, and check-in on
the event day.
Your mission is to design and implement a basic event reporting system for this platform.
What You Need to Do
1. Document Your Approach
● Note down your assumptions and decisions.
● Use an LLM tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to brainstorm.
● Share your AI conversation log (screenshots or links).
● Mention where you followed or deviated from AI suggestions.
2. Design Document
Your design doc should cover:
● Data to Track → Event creation, student registration, attendance, feedback.
● Database Schema → ER diagram or table sketch.
● API Design → Endpoints for creating events, registering students, marking
attendance, generating reports.
● Workflows → Sequence diagrams for registration → attendance → reporting.
● Assumptions & Edge Cases → e.g., duplicate registrations, missing feedback,
cancelled events.
3. Prototype Implementation
A small, working prototype (any language/framework):
● Database: SQLite/Postgres/MySQL.
● Create APIs or scripts to:
○ Register students to an event.
○ Mark attendance.
○ Collect feedback (rating 1–5).
● Provide queries or endpoints for reports:
○ Total registrations per event.
○ Attendance percentage.
○ Average feedback score.
4. Reports
● Event Popularity Report → Sorted by number of registrations.
● Student Participation Report → How many events a student attended.
Bonus
● Query/report for Top 3 Most Active Students.
● Flexible reports (e.g., filter by event type – Workshop/Fest/Seminar).
● Simple UI mockups/wireframes for browsing and registering for events.
Scale Assumption
Assume the system will be used by ~50 colleges, each with ~500 students and ~20 events
per semester.
Consider:
● Should event IDs be unique across colleges?
● Would you keep data separate per college, or maintain one large dataset?
Guidelines
● Keep your solution clear and practical.
● Clean, minimal code > large incomplete attempts.
● Document your assumptions and reasoning.
● Use AI to support you, but the final decisions should be yours.
Deliverables
You need to submit a Zip file (or GitHub repo) containing: (If you are sharing the GitHub
repo, kindly share access to neel@webknot.in)
1. AI conversation log (screenshots or links).
2. Design document.
3. Prototype code + README (with setup/run instructions).
○ ⚠️ Important: The README must include your own understanding of the
project and should be written personally without using AI tools. If we
suspect AI-generated README content, your profile will be disqualified
immediately.
4. Reports/outputs (queries or screenshots).
Deadline & Submission
● Deadline: 7th September 2025 (Sunday), before 3:00 PM IST.
● Submission: All assignments must be submitted through the official Google Form.
That’s it! We don’t just want to see your coding skills — we want to see how you think,
design, and execute. Don’t overcomplicate things. Keep it simple, keep it clean, and most
importantly, have fun building!
Good luck, and may the best Webknight rise! 🏆✨
